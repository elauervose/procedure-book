1. Turn on TeleMetrum (SW 4)
    i. Listen for beeps. 3 beeps good, low tone bad, 10 seconds Morse P ( .--. )
    i. Radio down to launch control to verify telemetry is streaming.
    i. Radio down to launch control to verify configuration coming from TeleMetrum is as expected.
1. Turn on ARTs (SW 3), verify good beep code (3 beeps).
1. Flight Director: Broadcast that Rocket is powered up and ready for flight.


## Final Pre-Launch Procedures

1. Lay out Ignition Extension Cable with 3 boxes.
   - Motor Box ~7ft away from nozzle.
   - Away Box as far as possible, but try to keep orange cord from being run over.
1. Communicate with Launch Control for go-ahead to hook up igniter
1. Clear all personnel other than L3
1. Check Manual Arm switch on LTC is "off"
1. Verify Banana shorting Jumper is well placed in LTC shorting block
1. Verify Motor Box indicator is dark
1. Verify alligator clips are connected to the motor box
1. Insert motor igniter into motor
1. Communicate with Launch Control that igniter is in.
1. Connect the alligator clips to Igniter
1. Switch Manual Arm Switch to **ON**
1. Communicate with Launch Control that Arm Switch is on
1. Remove Banana shorting jumper
1. Move Away from the box
1. Final check that area is clear of other personnel
1. Verify that red LED in away box is OFF.
1. Insert shorting jumper into the Away box
