1. Lay top tower and bottom tower end-to-end on ground, at 120 degrees off center such that antenna bar will point down during lifting
1. Put top and bottom tower pieces together, aligning the A, B, C indicators, with 1/4-20 hex bolts/nuts
1. Put base of tower on
1. Mount rail alignment brackets
  1. Loose fit launch rail alignment brackets, look for markings on the brackets and on the tower
  1. Lay mount launch rail to pivot point, and lay down to align brackets, then tighten brackets in place
  1. Remove launch rail.
1. Pre-string ropes from the top tower piece toward the bottom, including quick-links that will be used to tie to rail
1. Set end of tower on ladder to raise top from ground
1. Mount the antenna and antenna bar
1. Attach and run the RF feedline to the antenna
1. Screw sand screw into ground near base of tower and affix rope/chain to base of tower and sand screw such that when the tower is put up it won't slip out from underneath the lifters
1. Pre-place sand screws at 120 degree intervals around tower, pre-attach guy wires to the tower and lay out on ground in approximate final locations
1. Place 3 people on the guy wire ends to assist in stabilization of tower during lifting
1. 3 strong people at tower base to push up tower
1. Push up tower, rotating tower 120 degrees such that antenna bar is pointing downward. When the tower goes up, rotate until it's in desired alignment.
1. Use high-torque to screw in sand screws in approximate locations, snug, but do not tighten
1. Install launch rail with pulleys
1. Draw up pulleys till rail is vertical
1. Get Level, and tighten and level the launch rail with guy-wire turnbuckles and chain links as necessary
1. Hang blast shield on tower behind where motor will start its burn
